# Twiggy Configuration
#
# Twiggy generates real-time directory structure and codebase index for Cursor AI
# Your AI always knows your codebase's structure and API surface automatically
# https://github.com/twiggy-tools/Twiggy
#
# This file controls what folders and files Twiggy monitors and indexes
# Note: Generated .cursor/rules/ files are not tracked in git by design

# Sync with .gitignore - automatically exclude anything in your .gitignore
syncWithGitignore: {sync_gitignore}

# File Structure Configuration
structure:
  # Output format: 'xml' (better for LLMs) or 'tree' (visual with ├── └──)
  format: {format}

  # Custom folders/files to exclude from structure generation
  # Examples: 'temp', 'src/old-stuff', 'docs/legacy/backup'
  exclude:
{structure_exclude}

# Codebase Indexing Configuration
# Extracts function signatures, types, interfaces, classes, and exports
# This helps AI understand what utilities and types exist in your codebase
indexing:
  # Enable/disable codebase indexing
  enabled: {indexing_enabled}

  # Include patterns (empty = index everything)
  # Examples: ["src/**/*.ts", "lib/**/*.ts"]
  include: {indexing_include}

  # Exclude patterns (in addition to defaults)
  # By default: test files, config files, build outputs, and node_modules are excluded
  # Add your own patterns here:
  exclude:
{indexing_exclude}
